Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt 
Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide certain features. Unlike the code described in the code used in Qt document, these libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.
Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the GPL, LGPL, or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they are using.
Run configure -help to see any options that may be available for controlling the use of these libraries.
Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can normally be found by reviewing the change history of the corresponding files in the public Qt repository. 
FreeType 2 (freetype) version 2.3.12
The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free, portable and high-quality software solutions for digital typography. We specifically target embedded systems and focus on bringing small, efficient and ubiquitous products. -- quoted from 3rdparty/freetype/docs/freetype2.html.
See qtbase/src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/FTL.txt and qtbase/src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/GPL.txt for license details.
See also the files in qtbase/src/3rdparty/harfbuzz, which are used by FreeType.
Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h, ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications has been made to these files:
Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name conflicts.
Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with _STANDALONE_ defined.
Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling rules.
Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even polygon fill rules.
Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c
Renamed: ftraster.h to qblackraster_p.h
Renamed: ftraster.c to qblackraster.c
Renamed: ftgrays.h to qgrayraster_p.h
Renamed: ftgrays.c to qgrayraster.c

Introduction
============

  This  license  applies to  source  files  distributed by  Catharon
  Productions,  Inc.  in  several  archive packages.   This  license
  applies  to all files  found in  such packages  which do  not fall
  under their own explicit license.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We  don't promise that  this software works.  However,  we are
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      Catharon Code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We disclaim  all warranties  covering the packages  distributed by
  Catharon  Productions, Inc.  and  assume no  liability related  to
  their use.

  Catharon Packages'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  Catharon  Package(s),  including  all  source code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

JPEG Software (libjpeg) version 8c
This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression method for full-color and gray-scale images.

JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not exactly identical to the input image. -- quoted from qtbase/src/3rdparty/libjpeg/README.

The Public Suffix List
The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:
Avoid privacy-damaging "supercookies" being set for high-level domain name suffixes
Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface
Accurately sort history entries by site
The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such "supercookies" mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the QNetworkCookieJar class).
See qtbase/src/network/access/qnetworkcookiejartlds_p.h.INFO for more information about how the list is used. 
IAccessible2 IDL Specification
IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web browsers such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream applications. -- quoted from http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2.

GBK Text Codec
GBK is an extension of the GB2312 character set for simplified Chinese characters, used in the People's Republic of China. GB is the abbreviation of Guojia Biaozhun (国家标准), which means national standard in Chinese, while K stands for Extension ("Kuozhan"). GBK not only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly unrepresentable, like the "rong" (镕) character in former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable.

TSCII Text Codec
The TSCII codec provides conversion to and from the Tamil TSCII encoding.
TSCII, formally the Tamil Standard Code Information Interchange specification, is a commonly used charset for Tamils.
This codec uses the mapping table found at http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5180/tsciiset.html. Tamil uses composed Unicode which might cause some problems if you are using Unicode fonts instead of TSCII fonts.

Clucene Core Library
CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene. It is a high-performance, full- featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene as it is written in C++. -- quoted from qttools/src/assistant/3rdparty/clucene/README.
The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both* licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.
To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License, Version 2.0
However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the GPL.
You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added features.
Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for more information.
