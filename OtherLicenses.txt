FreeType
Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h, ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications has been made to these files:
Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name conflicts in qrasterdefs_p.h.
Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with _STANDALONE_ defined.
Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling rules.
Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even polygon fill rules.
Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c.
Renamed ftraster.h as qblackraster_p.h.
Renamed ftraster.c as qblackraster.c.
Renamed ftgrays.h as qgrayraster_p.h.
Renamed ftgrays.c as qgrayraster.c.
